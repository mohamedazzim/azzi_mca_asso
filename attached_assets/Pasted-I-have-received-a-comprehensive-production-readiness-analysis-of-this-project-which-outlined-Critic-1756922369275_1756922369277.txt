I have received a comprehensive production readiness analysis of this project, which outlined Critical, High Priority, and Nice-to-Have issues that prevent it from being fully production-ready.

Now I want you to:

Go through the entire list of pending issues (Critical ‚Üí High Priority ‚Üí Nice-to-Have).

For each issue, do the following in sequence:

Implement the complete fix or improvement.

Run necessary checks/tests to confirm that the fix works correctly.

Only after confirming success, move to the next issue in the list.

Ensure that:

Backup/restore/migration scripts are fully functional.

Build configuration no longer suppresses TypeScript/ESLint errors.

Console statements are removed from production code.

Security measures (rate limiting, CORS, headers, input validation, request throttling, file system monitoring, environment variable validation) are all enforced.

Error handling is robust at both global and component levels.

Performance is optimized (compression, caching, bundle splitting, lazy loading, Next.js image optimizations, indexing, etc.).

UI/UX polish is done (loading states, skeletons, accessibility fixes, responsive mobile-friendly tables, contextual error messages).

Analytics & charts are implemented with real data, not placeholders.

Advanced features like notifications, offline support, search optimization, and bulk operations are added.

Developer experience is improved (automated tests, API docs, debugging tools).

After completing all fixes, provide a final production readiness verification report that includes:

‚úÖ Fixed issues summary

‚ö° Improvements made

üõ°Ô∏è Security & performance validation

üìä New production readiness score across Functionality, Security, Performance, Reliability, UX, Maintainability

‚ö†Ô∏è Important:

Do not skip or leave placeholders. Every item from Critical ‚Üí High ‚Üí Nice-to-Have must be fully fixed or implemented.

Work autonomously, without asking me after each fix.

Only report back when the entire system is 100% production-ready, tested, and verified.
